Considerations before generating position placement manufacturing files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
All panel boards must be in the same rotation, for the placement machine.
If panel boards are rotated, rotate single board before generating pos.

A) Mark drill and position origin on lower left corner for top layer.
B) Move top layer manufacturing file in safety before regenerating bottom.
C) Mark drill and position origin on lower right corner for bottom layer.
D) Move safety top layer manufacturing file back to original file name.
E) Optionally combine top and bottom layers, using care with T/B fields.

Ensure that fiducials are in the generated placement files, use smt.
Import to new project in placement machine, do not mirror bottom.
Create a separate placement project for each (top|bottom) layer.
Rearrange parts list to reflect speed optimised board area order.
Move fiducials to bottom of list and delete jumpers and graphics.
Set all nonplacement parts (fiducials and DNP items) to skip.
Copy fiducial positions to marker array and consider values.

Finally, reencode character data from LF to CRLF EOL endings.
